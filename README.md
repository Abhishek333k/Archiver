# SNOTE URL Batch Script

This repository contains a batch script that creates folders for specified SNOTE numbers and opens corresponding URLs in new tabs in Firefox. 

## Contents

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare `urls.txt`

http://link5.com
http://link6.com
http://link7.com

   ```
3. Save this file in the same directory as the batch script.

### Step 2: Configure the Batch Script

2. The script will create folders named after specified SNOTE numbers and open all URLs listed in `urls.txt` in new tabs in Firefox.

### Notes
